### **ReAct Process Flow**
```
Question: Generate Market Context for US Equity Core Q1 2024

Thought: I need to research market conditions for Q1 2024 first
Action: market_research
Action Input: Q1 2024
Observation: Market research data shows strong tech performance...

Thought: Now I have market data, I can generate the commentary
Action: commentary_generation
Action Input: US Equity Core, Q1, 2024, S&P 500, [market_data], focus on tech
Observation: Generated comprehensive Market Context section...

Thought: I should review this for quality and improvements
