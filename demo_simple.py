## Economic Overview
The first quarter of 2024 was marked by continued economic resilience despite ongoing uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy. The Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate at 5.25-5.50%, signaling a cautious approach to monetary policy as inflation showed signs of moderation. Core CPI inflation eased to 3.1% year-over-year, down from previous quarters, while the labor market remained robust with unemployment holding steady at 3.8%.

## Market Performance
Equity markets demonstrated strong performance during the quarter, with the S&P 500 Index advancing 10.6% and the technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite gaining 8.4%. Market volatility, as measured by the VIX, remained elevated at an average of 18.2, reflecting ongoing investor sensitivity to economic data and central bank communications.

## Sector Analysis
Technology sector led market performance with a 15.2% gain, driven by continued enthusiasm around artificial intelligence and strong earnings growth from major technology companies. Healthcare sector also performed well, advancing 8.7%, while financials posted modest gains of 3.2%. Energy sector was the notable laggard, declining 2.1% due to concerns about global demand and supply dynamics.

## Global Factors
International markets showed mixed performance, with developed markets generally outperforming emerging markets. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and ongoing conflict in Ukraine continued to create market uncertainty, while currency fluctuations impacted international returns for U.S. investors.

## Market Drivers
Key factors influencing market direction included:
‚Ä¢ Strong corporate earnings growth across multiple sectors
‚Ä¢ Federal Reserve's measured approach to interest rate policy
‚Ä¢ Continued innovation and adoption of AI technologies
‚Ä¢ Geopolitical developments and their impact on global trade
‚Ä¢ Inflation trends and their implications for monetary policy"""
